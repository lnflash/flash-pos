- **100% backward compatibility** preserving existing flows
- **🆕 External payment rewards** for cash/card transactions with Bitcoin rewards

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Environment Configuration

Add these variables to your `.env` file for initial setup:

```bash
# Reward System Configuration
DEFAULT_REWARD_RATE=0.02          # 2% default reward rate
MIN_REWARD_SATS=1                 # Minimum 1 sat reward
MAX_REWARD_SATS=1000              # Maximum 1000 sats reward
STANDALONE_REWARD_SATS=21         # Classic 21-sats for flashcard taps
REWARDS_ENABLED=true              # Enable rewards system
```

### Merchant Configuration

1. **Navigate to Profile** → Open the Profile tab in Flash POS
2. **Find Reward Settings** → Scroll to the new "Reward Settings" section
3. **Configure Your Strategy**:
   - **Reward Rate**: Set percentage (0-10%) customers earn on purchases
   - **Minimum Reward**: Ensure customers always get at least X sats
   - **Maximum Reward**: Cap rewards to control costs
   - **Standalone Reward**: Amount for flashcard taps without purchase
   - **System Toggle**: Enable/disable entire rewards system
4. **Save Settings** → Tap "Save Settings" to apply changes
5. **Test Your Setup** → Make a small test purchase to verify

## 📊 Business Strategy Examples

### Conservative Strategy (Risk-Averse)
```
Reward Rate: 1.0%
Minimum Reward: 1 sat
Maximum Reward: 500 sats
Standalone Reward: 10 sats
```
**Use Case**: Steady customer retention with controlled costs
**Monthly Cost**: ~5,500 sats for 100 transactions + standalone taps

### Aggressive Strategy (Growth-Focused)
```
Reward Rate: 5.0%
Minimum Reward: 5 sats
Maximum Reward: 2000 sats
Standalone Reward: 50 sats
```
**Use Case**: Rapid customer acquisition and large purchase incentivization
**Monthly Cost**: ~27,500 sats for 100 transactions + standalone taps

### Promotional Campaign
```
Reward Rate: 10.0% (maximum allowed)
Minimum Reward: 10 sats
Maximum Reward: 5000 sats
Standalone Reward: 100 sats
```
**Use Case**: Limited-time promotions and special events
**Monthly Cost**: ~55,000 sats for 100 transactions + standalone taps

## 💰 Cost Calculator

Use this formula to estimate your monthly reward costs:

```
Monthly Cost = (Avg Purchase × Rate × Transactions) + (Standalone × Taps)

Example:
- Average purchase: 5,000 sats
- Reward rate: 2%
- Monthly transactions: 100
- Standalone taps: 50

Cost = (5,000 × 0.02 × 100) + (21 × 50)
     = 10,000 + 1,050 = 11,050 sats (~$4.42 @ $40k BTC)
```

## 🔄 Customer Experience Flow

### Purchase-Based Rewards (Lightning Payments)
1. **Customer makes purchase** → Amount calculated in Invoice screen
2. **Payment completed** → System automatically navigates to Rewards
3. **Enhanced Rewards screen** → Shows purchase context and calculated reward
4. **Flashcard tap** → Customer taps their flashcard to claim
5. **Celebratory success** → Enhanced success screen with breakdown
6. **Transaction recorded** → Complete reward information stored

### External Payment Rewards (Cash/Card/Other) 🆕
1. **Merchant enters amount** → Uses Keypad screen for external payment amount
2. **"Give Points" button** → Merchant presses new button instead of "Next"
3. **Direct to Rewards** → Bypasses payment flow, goes straight to reward calculation
4. **Enhanced Rewards screen** → Shows external payment context and calculated reward
5. **Flashcard tap** → Customer taps their flashcard to claim Bitcoin rewards
6. **Success confirmation** → Shows reward earned for external payment
7. **Transaction recorded** → Stored as "rewards-only" transaction type

### Standalone Rewards (Legacy Support)
1. **Customer taps flashcard** → Without making purchase
2. **Classic Rewards screen** → Shows default reward amount
3. **Instant distribution** → 21 sats (or configured amount) distributed
4. **Success confirmation** → Clean success screen for standalone reward

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Redux State Management
```typescript
interface RewardState {
  rewardRate: number;           // 0.00 - 0.10 (0% - 10%)
  minimumReward: number;        // Minimum sats ≥ 1
  maximumReward: number;        // Maximum sats ≥ minimum
  defaultReward: number;        // Standalone reward ≥ 1
  isEnabled: boolean;           // Global system toggle
}
```

### Calculation Engine
```typescript
const calculateReward = (purchaseAmount?, config) => {
  // Standalone rewards when no purchase
  if (!purchaseAmount) return config.defaultReward;
  
  // Percentage-based calculation
  const calculated = Math.floor(purchaseAmount * config.rewardRate);
  
  // Apply constraints
  return Math.max(config.minimumReward, 
                 Math.min(config.maximumReward, calculated));
};
```

### Enhanced Navigation
```typescript
// Purchase flow with context
navigation.navigate('Rewards', {
  purchaseAmount: 5000,
  purchaseCurrency: 'USD',
  purchaseDisplayAmount: '$2.00',
  transactionId: 'tx_123'
});
```
